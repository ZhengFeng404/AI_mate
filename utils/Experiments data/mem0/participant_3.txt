            "ai_response": "It's a shame she didn't seem to appreciate your effort tonight, Alex.Wasn't it basil leaves you found made your Italian dishes so fragrant?As for how much is \"too much\"... well, taste can be quite personal, don't you think?Maybe she just had a different craving today."

            "ai_response": "Hmm, less often than you'd like, perhaps?It's sweet that she's concerned about your skin, Alex.Could it be related to the barbecues you mentioned?Sometimes smoke and certain foods can have an effect, don't you think?"
